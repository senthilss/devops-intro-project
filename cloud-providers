* Cloud Providers
Note: All of these services provide free accounts with some limitations that are sufficient for testing this project. You do however need a credit card to sign up.

* Google Cloud Platform https://cloud.google.com/
Google Cloud Platform provides a free trial worth $300 for the first 60 days after you create a new account. Create a new project and enable Google Compute Engine API for the project. In the appropriate *-server.json file replace the value for project_id with the project ID of the new project you created earlier. It is currently set to "devops-intro-project", but it has to be replaced with your own project ID.

You will also have to create secret keys for use with Packer. Documentation can be found on the Packer Docs for Google Compute Engine (https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/googlecompute.html); see the subsection "Running Without A Compute Engine Service Account". Rename the downloaded json file to "account.json" and place it in the packer-templates directory.

To build the image use a command in the following format:

packer build -only=googlecompute <server-name>.json

For example, packer build -only=googlecompute application-server.json will build an image using the configuration specified in the application-server.json file in the packer-templates directory.

You can find the newly built image under 'Compute->Compute Engine->Images' menu on your project page at https://console.developers.google.com site. You can now use the image to launch a new server instance (be sure to check "allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic"), and from the "VM Instances" menu see the running instance and its IP, as well as use ssh to connect to it.

* Amazon Web Services
Amazon AWS provides a free trial for the first 12 months after creating your account using the free tier (http://aws.amazon.com/free/). The free account capabilities are fairly limited. The builder for AWS is preconfigured to use micro instances that are free with trial account. No special configuration for Packer is required.

You will have to create secret keys for use with Packer. To set up your AWS account, follow the instructions on Amazon's AWS Docs page (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html).

Documentation for Packer related to Amazon AWS can be found on the Packer Docs page for Amazon EC2 (https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs.html). To build the image use a command in the following format:

packer build -only=amazon-ebs <server-name>.json

For example, packer build -only=amazon-ebs application-server.json will build an image using the configuration specified in the application-server.json file in the packer-templates directory.

* Microsoft Azure Cloud
MS Azure provides a free trial (http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) for 30 days worth $200. Using Packer is slightly more complicated with Azure, as you need to install an additional Packer plugin. This plugin and installation instructions can be found here (https://github.com/msopentech/packer-azure). You only need the packer-builder-azure.

* Other Cloud Providers
It is possible to use Packer with other cloud providers. The full list of builders can be found on the Packer Docs page (https://www.packer.io/docs).
